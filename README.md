1. This is a paragraph about my project. It's pretty much a duplicate of what we did in class plus one additional feature. It allows multiple users to connect to a server and broadcast messages to all sockets or another users socket. Also, they can change their names :D

2. how to get the server running. In sure you are in the repos lab-eddie directory. In the terminal, type npm i to install any necessary dependancies. After they're installed type node server.js. It should display the port you're running on. Keep track of this!!!

3. (Mac OS) To connect to the server. open a new terminal tab/window. Type ifconfig and hit enter. A long list of weird information will be displayed. 12 lines down, right after inet, there will be an ip address. Keep track of it as well!!!
in the terminal, type telnet followed by the ip address followed by the port (spaces in-between all of them).
